    <h3>Crispy and savory snack</h3>
    <p>Taiwanese green onion pancake, or <em>cong you bing</em> is a delicious savoury street snack that is easy to batch make and freeze.</p>
    <p>It can be cooked from frozen, making it the perfect food for when you have unexpected guests or run out of dinner ideas. It's a simple recipe beloved for its flaky, crispy texture.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>6-8 scallions</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the dumpling wrappers out of the refrigerator, and let them warm up a bit (they don't necessarily have to be at room temperature, but they shouldn't be cold). Wash the scallions and pat them thoroughly dry with a clean kitchen towel. Slice the scallions in half lengthwise and finely chop them.</li>
        <li>Prepare a small dish of salt and a dish of oil, along with a pastry brush.</li>
        <li>On a clean work surface, take a dumpling wrapper, brush it with a thin layer of oil, and lightly sprinkle with salt. Then cover with a layer of scallions. Top it with another dumpling wrapper, and lightly press it down. Repeat the process until you have 4-7 layers of dumpling wrappers.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to roll the layered dumpling skins into a pancake––however thick or thin you like. Rotate the scallion pancake as you roll to get a perfect round shape.</li>
        <li>Heat a flat-bottomed non-stick or cast iron pan over medium heat. Spread 1 tablespoon oil around in the pan, and add the scallion pancake. Cook each side until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. (Avoid using high heat, as it will burn the pancake without cooking it through).</li>
        <li>If the pan looks dry after flipping the pancake, you can add another tablespoon of oil.</li>
        <li>Enjoy these plain or with a dipping sauce! We’ve found that they go great with our dumpling dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
